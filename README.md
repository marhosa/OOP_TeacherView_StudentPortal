Hereâ€™s the documentation for the `Subject` class in the style you requested:

---

**CLASS: Subject**

---

**CONSTRUCTOR**

Subject(String Subject_Name, int Subject_Code)

- Parameters:
  - `Subject_Name`: Name of the subject (String).
  - `Subject_Code`: Code of the subject (int).
  
- Description: Initializes a `Subject` object with the provided `Subject_Name` and `Subject_Code`. Initializes a 2D array `Subject_Grades` to store student numbers and their corresponding grades, with a maximum of 100 students.

---

**METHODS**

---

- Description: Returns the maximum number of students allowed in the subject (`Max_Students`), which is set to 100.

---

**getStudentnumandgrade()**

- Parameters: None.
  
- Description: Returns a 2D array of enrolled students and their grades. The first row contains the student numbers, and the second row contains their corresponding grades. Only enrolled students are included in this array (i.e., those whose student number is not zero).

---

**changeGrade(int SN, int grade)**

- Parameters:
  - `SN`: Student number (int).
  - `grade`: New grade to be assigned (int).
  
- Description: Updates the grade of the student with the given student number (`SN`). It searches the `Subject_Grades` array and modifies the grade of the matching student.

---

**getSubject_Name()**

- Parameters: None.
  
- Description: Returns the name of the subject (`Subject_Name`) as a `String`.

---

**getSubject_Code()**

- Parameters: None.
  
- Description: Returns the code of the subject (`Subject_Code`) as an `int`.

---

**isEnrolled(int SN)**

- Parameters:
  - `SN`: Student number (int).
  
- Description: Checks if the student with the given student number (`SN`) is enrolled in the subject. Returns `true` if the student is found in the `Subject_Grades` array, `false` otherwise.

---

**removeStudent(int SN)**

- Parameters:
  - `SN`: Student number (int).
  
- Description: Removes the student with the given student number (`SN`) from the subject. It sets both the student number and their grade to zero in the `Subject_Grades` array.

---

**getStudent_Grade(int SN)**

- Parameters:
  - `SN`: Student number (int).
  
- Description: Returns the grade of the student with the given student number (`SN`). If the student is not found, it returns `-10`.

---

**setSubject_Name(String Subject_Name)**

- Parameters:
